# Kata Site

This is a personal kata site I created as part of my internship with AugustTwenty. In addition to working on the Ogantry Accounting Software, I was assigned to create this site as a capstone project.

The objective of this assignment was to demonstrate skills I learned during the internship by implementing 'katas' in a web application utilizing Node, Express, Bootstrap, Heroku, Github Actions, Jest and programming skills learned during the internship

## Requirements

- Create an empty directory and turn it into a git repo
- Create an Express application in that repo
- The Express app should contain both an API component and serve up at least one HTML page
- The HTML should contain multiple kata implementations, implemented inside of Bootstrap Accordians. (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/)
- The kata implementation should have form elements that allow the user to pass in values and the kata implementation will display the correct results.
- Each kata should have appropriate unit tests confirming the expected behavior.
- The code should be implemented on the back end and your HTML should communicate with your API to get the result.
- Write a GitHub actions config that runs your tests when code is merged.
- Create a Heroku account and connect it to the GitHub repo
- Configure Heroku to automatically deploy code when tests pass successfully.
